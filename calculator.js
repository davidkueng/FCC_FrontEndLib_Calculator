// if a button is pressed -> push number from value into a display array (innerHTML from id with whitespace)

// if clear is pressed -> delete all values in display array

// if equals is pressed -> do the math of array and push result with calculation into array (reduce?)

// make sure to keep the whole calculations in array with the result.

// make sure that if there are several operators (+-*/) only the only the last one counts
